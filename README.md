# McBoop

The fastest ( I've seen ) Minecraft launcher

This launcher is designed around using commands, This allows easy scripting letting you to have for example a shell script/batch file on your desktop that when run would always launch the latest snapshot/stable version even as it get updated!

This launcher also fully supports EVERY forge version and profiles allowing you to easily run your or your friends modpacks without having to use the cursed launcher that shall not be named! ( For pulling packs off curseforge see [CurseDownloader](https://git.sergal.org/Sir-Boops/CurseDownloader) )

Things the launcher can do:
* Run any version of MC offically listed
* Use multiple accounts at once
* Run multiple copies of Minecraft at once
* Run using predefined profiles
* Run Forge modpacks
* Run older versions of Minecraft with sound
