# McBoop
## The quick little MC launcher!
* Lightweight af
* Dosn't store your password
* Runs every version with working sound
* Auto updates ( I can hear atleast one of you screaming )
* Forge support from 1.6 to current ( older versions are a pain )
* Fabric support
* Works on Linux and Windows!
* CLI only means this can be used nearly anywhere
* Handles Java for you, So you don't need to install anything

Enjoy :)
